= Configuring PuzzleDB

PuzzleDB is configured using a configuration file. The configuration file is a YAML file, and you can override the configuration by setting environment variables.

== Configuration File (puzzledb.yaml)

The configuration file is divided into sections. Each section is a YAML map. PuzzleDB will activate a default configuration if a configuration file is not specified or if there is no puzzledb.yaml in the local directory. The following is a default configuration file:

[options="yaml"]
----
include::../puzzledb/conf/puzzledb.yaml[]
----

== Environment Variables

You can override the configuration file location by setting the PUZZLEDB environment variable. PuzzleDB assumes that the environment variable matches the following format: PUZZLEDB + "_" + the key name in ALL CAPS.

For example, if the environment variable `PUZZLEDB_LOGGING_ENABLED` is set, then PuzzleDB will override the `logging:enabled` setting.
