= Configuring PuzzleDB

PuzzleDB is configured using a configuration file. The default configuration file is located at `conf/puzzledb.yaml`. 

== Environment Variables

You can override the configuration file location by setting the PUZZLEDB environment variable. PuzzleDB assumes that the environment variable matches the following format: PUZZLEDB + "_" + the key name in ALL CAPS.

For example, if the configuration parameter is "logging:enabled", PuzzleDB will look for the environment variable "PUZZLEDB_LOGGING_ENABLED".

== Configuration File (puzzledb.yaml)

The configuration file is a YAML file. The configuration file is divided into sections. Each section is a YAML map.  The following is an example configuration file:

[options="yaml"]
----
include::../puzzledb/conf/puzzledb.yaml[]
----
