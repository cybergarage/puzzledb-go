== Configuring PuzzleDB

PuzzleDB is configured using a YAML file; settings can be overridden through environment variables.

=== Configuration File (puzzledb.yaml)

The configuration file is divided into sections (YAML maps). A default configuration is activated if no file is specified and `puzzledb.yaml` is absent in the working directory. The default is shown below:

[options="yaml"]
----
include::../puzzledb/conf/puzzledb.yaml[]
----

=== Environment Variables

Define environment variables matching `PUZZLEDB_<UPPERCASE_KEY>` to override individual settings. (The configuration file path itself can also be overridden.)

Example: `PUZZLEDB_LOGGER_ENABLED=true` overrides `logging.enabled`.
