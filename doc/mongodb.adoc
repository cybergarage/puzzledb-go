= MongoDB Comptibility

PuzzleDB supports MongoDB API based on https://github.com/cybergarage/go-mongo[go-mongo], a database framework that makes it easy to implement MongoDB compatible servers using Go.

The https://github.com/cybergarage/go-mongo[go-mongo] framework automatically handles the MongoDB protocol and system commands. Therefore, PuzzleDB achieves MongoDB compatibility by implementing only user query commands.

== Data Model

PuzzleDB is a multi-data model database and the core data model is a document model; PuzzleDB converts MongoDB data model, https://bsonspec.org/[BSON (Binary JSON)], into the PuzzleDB data model as follows:

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
|====
include::model/mongodb.csv[]
|====

== Supported Commands

PuzzleDB currently supports https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/[MongoDB database commands] in stages. This section describes the status of MongoDB command support in PuzzleDB.

=== Diagnostic Commands

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
|====
include::mongo/diagnostic.csv[]
|====

=== Replication Commands

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
|====
include::mongo/replication.csv[]
|====

=== Query and Write Operation Commands

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
|====
include::mongo/query.csv[]
|====

== Indexing

Currently, PuzzleDB automatically indexes all sigle fields of inserted and updated documents by default, as CosmosDB does. In the future, PuzzleDB will support indexing of only the specified fields like MongoDB or more smart indexing like CosmosDB.
