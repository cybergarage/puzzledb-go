= MongoDB Comptibility

PuzzleDB supports MongoDB API based on https://github.com/cybergarage/go-mongo[go-mongo], a database framework that makes it easy to implement MongoDB compatible servers using Go.

The https://github.com/cybergarage/go-mongo[go-mongo] framework automatically handles the MongoDB protocol and system commands. Therefore, PuzzleDB achieves MongoDB compatibility by implementing only user query commands.
