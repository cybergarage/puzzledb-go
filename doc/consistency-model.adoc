== Consistency Model

PuzzleDB is a multi‑data‑model database; storage layer modules are expected to satisfy ACID semantics through a common interface.

PuzzleDB defines its top-level storage plugin as a document model interface composed of transaction and document primitives.

While non‑ACID backends could be implemented, PuzzleDB strongly recommends ACID‑compliant ordered key‑value storage for correctness and predictable consistency.
