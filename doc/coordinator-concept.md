# Coordinator Concept

Coordinator services (e.g., ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul) manage configuration, synchronization, and coordination for distributed applications, helping maintain consistency and availability.

In distributed mode PuzzleDB runs as multiple instances. Each plugin service across instances is coordinated via the configured coordinator plugin.

The coordinator plugin provides synchronization, membership management, and state propagation for PuzzleDB nodes.
