# Coordinator Concept

In distributed mode, PuzzleDB assumes that it will be launched as multiple distributed instances, and each plug-in service (such as query plug-ins) launched on each instance should be coordinated using the coordinator service plug-in.

The coordinator service plug-in is used to manage and synchronize the distributed PuzzleDB nodes.
