== Storage Concepts

Storage plugins should provide transaction‑enabled, ordered, sharded NoSQL capabilities (similar to Google Spanner or FoundationDB).

=== Ordered Key-Value Store

PuzzleDB defines its storage interface as an ACID‑compliant ordered key‑value store (similar to early Spanner / FoundationDB), contrasting with unordered hash‑based stores.

Ordered stores optimize range scans, point lookups, and transactional semantics in large‑scale distributed deployments.

Sorted keys enable efficient range queries and predictable operational performance.

=== Data Model

PuzzleDB’s logical layer is a document model encoded onto the ordered key‑value substrate. All objects (data, schema, indexes) are documents persisted as key‑value entries.

The document model must be expressive (JSON/BSON level) similar to CosmosDB’s ARS. See link:data-model.md[Data Model] for details.
