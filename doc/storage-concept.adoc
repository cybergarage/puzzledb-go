= Storage Concepts

In PuzzleDB, the storage plugins are expected to be implemented as transaction-enabled, ordered sharding NoSQL storage systems, similar to Google Spanner or FoundationDB.

PuzzleDB defines its storage interface as an ordered key-value store, akin to early Google Spanner and FoundationDB. PuzzleDB expects its storage plugin components to be implemented based on an ordered key-value store, in contrast to unordered hash-like key-value stores found in MongoDB and Cassandra. The implementation should be based on ACID-compliant ordered key-value stores.

FoundationDB and early Google Spanner utilize ordered key-value stores to support their unique features and capabilities in managing large-scale distributed databases. By organizing the keys in a sorted manner, these databases can optimize storage, retrieval, and update operations. This ordered structure also enables the databases to maintain consistency and achieve high performance in distributed environments.

Ordered key-value stores are a fundamental component of the storage layers in distributed databases like FoundationDB and Google Spanner. By maintaining keys in a sorted order, these systems can efficiently handle range queries and optimize various operations in large-scale distributed environments.
