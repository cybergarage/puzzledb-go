= MySQL Compatibility

PuzzleDB supports MySQL commands based on https://github.com/cybergarage/go-mysql[go-mysql], a database framework that makes it easy to implement MySQL compatible servers using Go.

The https://github.com/cybergarage/go-mysql[go-mysql] framework automatically handles the MySQL protocol and system commands. Therefore, PuzzleDB achieves Redis compatibility by implementing only simply handling DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) query commands.

== Data Model

PuzzleDB is a multi-data model database and the core data model is a document model; PuzzleDB converts https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html[MySQL data types] into the PuzzleDB data model as follows:

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
|====
include::model/mysql.csv[]
|====

== Supported commands

PuzzleDB currently supports https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-statements.html[MySQL statements] in stages. This section describes the status of Redis command support in PuzzleDB.

===  Data Definition Statements

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
