= Key-Value Store Specification

In PuzzleDB, records, schemas, and indices are all represented as key-value pairs. This section explains the format of the key-value data used in PuzzleDB.

== Key Categories

The key-value store is a collection of key-value records, where each record is a key-value pair, consisting of a header as the key. The key-value store supports the following categories of key-value records:

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
|====
include::csv/kv-store-category.csv[]
|====

== Key Header Specification

The key header is a 2-byte header that is prepended to every key in the key-value store. The key header is defined as follows:

[format="csv", options="header, autowidth"]
|====
include::csv/kv-store-header.csv[]
|====

The key header begins with a 1-byte identifier for the key type, enabling key type-based searching. The value type is then defined for each key type.
