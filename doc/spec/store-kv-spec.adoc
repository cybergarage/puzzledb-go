= Key Object

In PuzzleDB, records, schemas, and indices are all represented as key-value pairs. This section details the format of the key object.

== Key Header Specification

Every key object includes a header that specifies the key category, version, and the stored value type. The key header is a 2-byte field prepended to every key in the key-value store and is structured as follows:

[format="csv", options="header,autowidth"]
|====
include::csv/kv-store-header.csv[]
|====

The key header starts with a 1-byte identifier representing the key type, enabling efficient key type-based searching. While duplication is permitted, a specific value type is reserved for each key type.

== Key Categories

The key-value store consists of key-value records, where each record is defined by a key-value pair and includes a header as the key. The store supports the following categories of key-value records:

[format="csv", options="header,autowidth"]
|====
include::csv/kv-store-category.csv[]
|====

Primary keys and secondary indices can compose one or multiple columns. Although omitted in the above table, the combination of the element name and value for both objects and indices is repeated depending on the index format. Additionally, since the index stores the primary key in its key section, its value section remains empty.
