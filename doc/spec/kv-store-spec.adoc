= Key-Value Store Specification

In PuzzleDB, both the coordinator service and the store service use key-value stores to store data. The coordinator uses a key-value store to store states, messages, jobs, and indices, while the store uses a key-value store to store to store records, schemas, and indices.

Since both services may use the same key-value store implementation, the key-value store specifications are designed not to affect each other. This document provides a list of these specifications.
