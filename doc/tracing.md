# Tracing

OpenTelemetry is an open-source project that provides a framework for collecting and exporting telemetry data. PuzzleDB supports OpenTelemetry, allowing developers to use a single API to instrument their instances and capture telemetry data. The data can be sent to observability tools for analysis and troubleshooting.
