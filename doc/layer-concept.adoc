= Layer Concept

PuzzleDB adopts a unique approach similar to FoundationDB and early Google Spanner. It offers high scalability and ACID transactions while constructing its data model, indexes, and query processing on a foundation of simple key-value storage without any query functionality. In PuzzleDB, not only are records represented as key-value pairs, but schemas and indices are also represented as key-value data.
