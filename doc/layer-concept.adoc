== Layer Concept

PuzzleDB adopts an approach similar to FoundationDB and early Google Spanner: high scalability and ACID transactions built atop a simple ordered key‑value substrate without embedded query functionality.

PuzzleDB loosely couples the query APIs, data model, and storage engine, enabling tailored compositions for specific workloads. Records, schemas, and indexes are all materialized as key‑value data.
