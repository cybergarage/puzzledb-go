= Data Model

PuzzleDB is a multi-data model database and the core data model is a document model, and the document model is constructed based on a key value model currently. PuzzleDB represents all database objects such as data objects, schema objects, and index objects as document data. Document data are ultimately stored as Key-Value objects.

PuzzleDB defines a plug-in interface to the Key-Value store, which allows importing small local in-memory databases like memdb or large distributed databases like FoundationDB or TiKV.

== Document Model

PuzzleDB is a multi-data model database and the core data model is a document model like CosmosDB. PuzzleDB is a pluggable database that combines modules, and the storage layer modules must be as expressive as JSON or BSON like ARS (Atom-Record-Sequence) of CosmosDB.

PuzzleDB is a multi-model database, which converts any data models such as relational and document database models into the PuzzleDB data model as follows:

== Key-Value Object Model

PuzzleDB stores all database objects into key-value objects, and the key-value model is the core data model of PuzzleDB. The key-value model is a simple data model that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. The key-value model is a flexible and scalable data model that can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently.

PuzzleDB represents all database objects such as data objects, schema objects, and index objects as document data. Document data are ultimately stored as key-value objects.

== Document (Value) Object

The document model is not natively implemented and is currently built on a key-value model with a coder plugin module. PuzzleDB provides a default coder, the CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation ) plug-in module as the default coder.

PuzzleDB encodes a document data with a coder and stores it as a key-value data. The relationship between the default coder, CBOR data model, and the document data model is shown below.
