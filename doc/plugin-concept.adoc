= Plug-In Concepts

PuzzleDB is a pluggable database that combines components, and a pluggable component interface is defined based on a FoundationDB-like layering concept. PuzzleDB separates the query layer and data model from the storage layer, the lowest storage layer is defined as a simple Key-Value store like FoundationDB and early Google Spanner.

PuzzleDB defines the coordinator and storage function interfaces to run as standalone and distributed databases. PuzzleDB runs as a distributed multi-API and multi-model database with the distributed coordinator and storage plug-ins.
