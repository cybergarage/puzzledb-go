= Plug-In Concepts

PuzzleDB is a pluggable database that amalgamates various components. It defines a pluggable component interface following a layering concept similar to FoundationDB. PuzzleDB separates the query layer and data model from the storage layer. The most basic storage layer is defined as a simple key-value store, much like FoundationDB and early Google Spanner.

PuzzleDB defines the coordinator and storage function interfaces to operate as standalone and distributed databases. Running with distributed coordinator and storage plug-ins, PuzzleDB functions as a distributed multi-API and multi-model database.
