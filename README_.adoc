PuzzleDB supports existing query protocols such as MongoDB, Redia, and
MySQL. Thus, developers can start using PuzzleDB as a scalable,
high-performance distributed database with existing database client
drivers without any learning curve.

The name PuzzleDB comes from the ability to combine multiple modules
such as coordinators, storages, and existing database protocol handlers
to form a database.
